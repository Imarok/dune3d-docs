Feature overview
=======================================

Sketch and constrain in 2D
--------------------------

Start your design by drawing lines, arcs and circles using the 
versatile draw contour tool.

Pick from over 20 constraints to best express your design intent.

Make it 3D with extrusion or lathe groups
---------------------------------------------

Use and reuse sketches made in 2D to create 3D objects using extrusion 
or lathe groups.

2D export options are available as well.


Versatile input device support
-------------------------------

With Dune 3D, you can make best use of modern laptop's pointing 
devices. Apart from pixel-precision zooming and panning using 
touchpads or trackpoints, you can use
touchscreen gestures such as pinch-to-zoom.
